                    I've been hearing symphonies
                    Before, all I heard was silence
                    A rhapsody for you and me
                    And every melody is timeless
                    Life was stringing me along
                    Then you came and you cut me loose
                    Was solo, singing on my own


                    Now I can't find the key without you
                    And now your song is on repeat
                    And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
                    And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
                    So, if you want the truth
                    I just wanna be part of your symphony
                    Will you hold me tight and not let go?

                    Symphony 

                    Like a love song on the radio
                    Will you hold me tight and not let go?
                    I'm sorry if it's all too much
                    Every day you're here, I'm healing
                    And I was runnin' out of luck
                    I never thought I'd find this feeling
                    'Cause I've been hearing symphonies
                    Before all I heard was silence


                    A rhapsody for you and me
                    (A rhapsody for you and me)
                    And every melody is timeless
                    And now your song is on repeat
                    And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
                    And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
                    So, if you want the truth
                    I just wanna be part of your symphony
                    Will you hold me tight and not let go?

                    Symphony

                    Like a love song on the radio
                    Will you hold me tight and not let go?
                    Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
                    Ah ah, ah
                    Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
                    Ah ah, ah


                    And now your song is on repeat
                    And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
                    And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
                    So, if you want the truth (oh)
                    I just wanna be part of your symphony
                    Will you hold me tight and not let go?

                    Symphony

                    Like a love song on the radio

                    Symphony

                    Will you hold me tight and not let go?

                    Symphony

                    Like a love song on the radio
                    Will you hold me tight and not let go?
