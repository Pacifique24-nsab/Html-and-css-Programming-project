         I'm 19 years old and a burundian citizen who was born at the 24th day of april in 2004.
          My father is called Cassien and my mother Floride. I have 6 siblings, 5 boys and one girl. In my life I'm passionate
           about learning  the world, because as Einsten said" the more you learn, the more you realise how much
           you don't know. so i Have that insatiable appetite of learning about the world around me.
        I am deeply committed to honing my skills in simulating human intelligence and task performance through machines,
        such as computer systems. My proficiency extends to Python, HTML, CSS, and Archicad, and I am fluent in both French 
        and English, with a basic understanding of Turkish.

            <dd> The Paroisse Regina Pacis de Kinindo, nestled in the heart of Kinindo, 
                a vibrant neighborhood in Bujumbura- the bustling capital city of Burundi, 
                serves as a beacon of faith and community engagement. As a parish, it is more
                than just a place of worship; it is a spiritual home for the local residents 
                and a cornerstone of the community. This parish likely plays a pivotal role in
                the lives of its congregants, offering not only religious services but also a 
                variety of community outreach programs. It provides a space for people to come
                together, to find spiritual guidance, and to support each other in times of need. 
                The parish likely hosts regular services, where community members can gather to 
                worship, reflect, and find solace. In addition to its religious functions, the Paroisse 
                Regina Pacis de Kinindo may also serve as a hub for social activities, educational programs
                (in teaching the youth very important lessons for everyday life)
                ,
                and charitable initiatives, further cementing its role as a vital community center..</dd>
